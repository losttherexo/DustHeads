DustHeads
by: Andr√© Vargas Roo

DustHeads is a social media platform for vinyl record collectors. Here you can sign up and records to your profile page along with any commentary you may want to add. You can also see what other users are posting and check out their profile page to see what else they're collecting and saying about those records.

This is meant to be an open source platform so if a record you own is not in our databases, fret not! The app will prompt you a few more questions so that way we can upload your post and allow others with the same record to share in the process.

This is all about the wonderful community of record enthusiasts so I am currently working on allowing users to befriend each other, add comments on each other's posts and in the future upload your own pictures or videos of the records you're finding.

Happy crate digging!
